Notes

first of all remove all the dependencies we aren't using

initialize the repository to the git and add the files in the git
commit the git files
create new repo to the git

just add the repo to the netlify and it will be ready

--------------------------------------------------------------

to host the page on the github unistall the dependencies 
and add dev dependencies to host on the github

npm i gh-pages -D       install it


in package.json underneath the version add 

"homepage": "htttps:// <add_user_name> .github.io/ <repo_name>",
"private": true,


add scripts to the package.json also

"predeploy" : "npm run build",
"deploy" : "gh-pages -d build",

after it initialize the github repo and add file in it after pushing the file

npm run deploy        (this will deploy the file in the github)
